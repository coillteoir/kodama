# Kodama

Kodama is a language for describing 3D models.

## Mission Statement

Due to the large complexity of 3D modelling tools such as Blender, it is difficult for beginners to enter the space.
It has been observed in fields such as programming that there is a clear progression curve in terms of the usability of tools.

For example in programming languages, we do not encourage beginners to learn rust or haskell.
We suggest languages such as Python, JavaScript, or C. 
This is because these languages provide a simple interface for writing programs, with the option of using more complicated features of the language.

This is contrasted with languages such as rust, or haskell, where the minimum level of knowledge for writing programs is much higher.

This is often called the skill floor.

It is not common for applications to have a high skill floor. This is often because they use a GUI for all operations. 
GUI applications need to have all options visible, or accessible in a short amount of clicks, or keyboard shortcuts.

As applications scale in complexity, their GUIs have to reflect that.

It is often necessary to allow users to create interesting things.

This is in contrast to programming languages, which can be seen as a subset of text based applications.
All the UI of a programming language is captured in a set of UTF-8 encoded keywords, and grammar.

This then means that no bespoke tools are mandatory for writing programs. 
This README was written in vim, but it could easily have been written in vscode, notepad, or even by hovering a magnet over my laptop.

Kodama aims to become a tool for users to describe 3D models in text.
This allows beginners to only be exposed to the parts of the language they need for their specific case, with any extra features only a google or docs search away.
